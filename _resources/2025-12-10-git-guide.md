Git is an essential tool for modern software development. This resource covers the basics.

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that helps teams collaborate on code.

## Key Concepts

- **Repository**: A project's version history
- **Commit**: A snapshot of changes
- **Branch**: An independent line of development
- **Merge**: Combining changes from different branches

## Getting Started

```bash
git init                    # Initialize a new repository
git add file.txt           # Stage changes
git commit -m "message"    # Create a commit
git push                   # Push to remote
```
