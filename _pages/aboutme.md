Hey there! My name is Jefferson, but you can call me Jeff. I was born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I am a data scientist by day, dog dad by night. Fueled by my passion for problem-solving, I decided to pursue a degree in Applied Mathematics. I first learned about Machine Learning in 2018, and I was immediately struck by the concept that a machine could "learn" patterns from data and use that knowledge to make predictions efficiently. Since I had a strong background in Mathematics and Statistics, it seemed natural for to pursue a career as a data scientist.
