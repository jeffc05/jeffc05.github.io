Hey there! My name is Jefferson, but you can call me Jeff. I was born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I am a data scientist by day, dog dad by night. Fueled by my passion for problem-solving, I decided to pursue a degree in Applied Mathematics.

I first learned about Machine Learning in 2018, and I was immediately struck by the concept that a machine could "learn" patterns from data and use that knowledge to make predictions efficiently. With my strong foundation in Mathematics and Statistics, it was a natural choice for me to embark on a career as a data scientist.

I have considerable experience in developing and deploying Machine Learning models across various industries, and I thrive on innovation and continuous learning. My curiosity keeps me exploring new concepts and ideas.

When I'm not immersed in data science, you can find me enjoying sports, watching series and movies, or indulging my passion for food by trying out different cuisines.
