This is a sample article demonstrating the articles collection functionality.

## Key Points

- Articles are separate from projects
- Grouped by publication year
- Each article has metadata (date, categories, tags)

## Example Code

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello from articles!")
```

Add more articles to the `_articles/` folder following this same format.
